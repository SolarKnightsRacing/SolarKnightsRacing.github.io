Our objective is to design and build solar-powered vehicles to compete in races across the nation, showcasing the potential of sustainable transportation. Through this club, we aim to inspire environmental responsibility while providing UCF students with hands-on experience in leadership, engineering, business, programming, and manufacturing. Additionally, we foster interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together students with diverse skill sets and backgrounds to achieve a common goal.
