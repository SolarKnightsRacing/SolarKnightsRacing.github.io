          <p>The classic American muscle car that started my collection. This '68 Mustang featured the 302 V8 engine with a 4-speed manual transmission. The Highland Green paint was inspired by the famous Bullitt movie car. I spent countless weekends restoring this beauty, focusing on preserving its original character while upgrading the brakes and suspension for improved safety and handling.</p>

          <p>My family adventure vehicle during the mid-2000s. This VW Bus Type 2 was configured as a Westfalia camper, complete with pop-top roof, fold-out bed, and a tiny but functional kitchenette. Though it wasn't the most powerful vehicle with its modest 2.0L air-cooled engine, it reliably took us on countless weekend camping trips and a memorable cross-country journey in 2007.</p>

          <p>My first leap into electric vehicles and still going strong. This early production Model S (P85) was a revolutionary change from my previous vehicles. With its instant torque, 265-mile range, and continuous software updates, it has remained surprisingly contemporary even after more than a decade. The spacious interior and front/rear trunk space make it remarkably practical for daily use and long trips using the Supercharger network.</p>
